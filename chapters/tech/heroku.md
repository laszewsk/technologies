Heroku's main goal is to support customer focused apps and is a cloud-based 
service. Heroku provides many simple, easy to use and efficient tools hence 
becoming a top PaaS provider. Heroku now supports Ruby, Java, Scala, Node.js,
Python and Clojure [@fa18-523-84-Heroku-1].

The projects that use Heroku does not need infrastructure support as the platform
also manages the hardware and servers. Several programming languages are supported
by Heroku. Polymorphism and scalability are what makes Heroku preferable for
smaller projects, Heroku uses a service model which is free and uses tired service
packages for complex projects. It is based on a managed container called dynos.
The integration of the data service is done with Heroku's ecosystem. This data
service enables the running of the modern applications [@fa18-523-84-Heroku-2].

Heroku has several add-ons. To analyze hosted applications logs, its events etc,
Heroku uses one of its add-on which is called the Treasure Data Hadoop.
> "Treasure Data toolbelt can be installed along with Heroku plugin to manage 
treasure Data Hadoop on Heroku" [@fa18-523-84-Heroku-3]. 

Treasure data collects,stores and analyzes large amount of data immediately.
This also helps in maintaining a log of the events. Typical uses cases are for:

-	Conversion path analysis
-	Ranking calculation
-	Reports of the customer etc [@fa18-523-84-Heroku-4].	

With Heroku any application can be deployed to the cloud with one push from Git.
Today, Heroku has expanded to offer Heroku Enterprise platform and a Heroku 
Postgres SQL database as a service for managing large amount of data on cloud.
Deployment of the applications in Heroku happens in the below mentioned ways:

-	Prepping: Heroku takes the applications source code, dependency description
  (instructions that is required for the application to run), and a file that 
  provides the process method of the app (procfile) which also exposes the 
  architectural components of the applications. These are the only components needed 
  to build an application and to generate an executable file in Heroku.
-	Exporting code Git: Heroku starts the build by pushing the code to Git using
  a simple command.
-	Build Phase:  During this phase the code is compiled, and the output is 
  generated.
-	Execution Phase: Heroku uses dynos which is a mini operating system, which
  handles the applications.
-	The release: The final product that Heroku delivers [@fa18-523-84-Heroku-5].
