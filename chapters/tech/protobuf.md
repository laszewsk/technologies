### Protocol Buffer 

Protocol Buffer is a way to serialize structured data into binary form in order to transfer it over wires or for storage. [@www-protobuf] It is used for inter application communication or for remote procedure call (RPC). It involves an interface description that describes the structure of some data and a program that can generate source code or parse it back to the binary form. It emphasizes simplicity and performance. Protocol Buffer allows user to define the schema for their data and put messages within the schema [@fa18-523-56-www-protobuf-codeclimate-chooseprobuf].

### Protocol Buffer Languages

Protocol Buffers has APIs for Python, Java, and C++ and other projects are in the works to implement other languages as well [@fa18-523-56-www-protobuf-googleother].Protocol Buffer defines it's schema definition in the .proto and is built with key/value pairs. 

### Protocol Buffer and xml

Protocol Buffers is compared frequently to xml. The tradeoff between xml and protocol buffers is read ability and speed/size. Protocal buffers are typically smaller, faster but require the consumer to have the protocol file to de-serialize the data [@fa18-523-56-www-protobuf-googledevoverview]. xml provides the information needed to parse but is typically slower to parse and transmit because of its size difference to Protocol Buffers [@fa18-523-56-www-protobuf-performancecompare].

### Protocol Buffer History 

Protocol Buffers was developed by Google and by 2008 was primary in much of Google's infrastructure. In 2008 Google made Protocol Buffers available open source. The project is available at <https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf>

### Protocol Buffers and Large Files

Protocol Buffers wasn't intended to deal with larger files [@fa18-523-56-www-protobuf-googletechniques]. Big data challenges frequently include larger files. However, Protocol Buffers is ideal for smaller structured pieces of a larger message. For example Google Maps files includes large amounts of data, but Protocol Buffers is the ideal solution because loading a large amount of data in small pieces is what where Protocol Buffers can excel.
