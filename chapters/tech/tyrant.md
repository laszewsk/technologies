Tyrant provides network interfaces to the database management system
called Tokyo Cabinet. Tyrant is also called as Tokyo Tyrant. Tyrant is
implemented in C and it provides APIs for Perl, Ruby and C. Tyrant
provides high performance and concurrent access to Tokyo Cabinet. The
results of performance experiments between Tyrant and Memcached +
MySQL can be viewed in the blog [@www-tyrant-blog].

Tyrant was written and maintained by FAL
Labs [@www-tyrant-fal-labs].  However, according to FAL Labs,
their latest product Kyoto Tycoon is more powerful and convenient
server than Tokyo Tyrant [@www-kyoto-tycoon].

Technology Summary - Jay Stockwell - fa18-523-61

Tokyo Tyrant is comprised of several packages of network interfaces that link to a complex database management system entitled Tokyo Cabinet [@www-tyrant-fal-labs]. The  Tokyo Cabinet is a set of routines used for the management of key-value databases, and was initially sponsored by the Japanese social media site Mixi [@en.wikipedia.tyrant]. Tokyo Tyrant provides a variety of methods to connect to the Tokyo cabinet database manager. The application includes a process whereby allowing for effective database management as well as its access library for client base applications [@www-tyrant-fal-labs].

Below is some additional technical information from the fallabs website:

> "The server features high concurrency due to thread-pool modeled implementation and the epoll/kqueue mechanism of the modern Linux/*BSD kernel. The server and its clients communicate with each other by simple binary protocol on TCP/IP. Protocols compatible with memcached and HTTP are also supported so that almost all principal platforms and programming languages can use Tokyo Tyrant. High availability and high integrity are also featured due to such mechanisms as hot backup, update logging, and replication. The server can embed Lua, a lightweight script language so that you can define arbitrary operations of the database" [@www-tyrant-fal-labs-specs].

You must install Tokyo Cabinet prior to using Tokyo Tyrant. The Tokyo Tyrant application is extracted into a new working directory location whereby a configuration script can be executed to complete the installation. The ttserver command is vital to the operation of the server, as well as determining the best usage of memory for the application.

> "The command 'ttserver' runs the server managing a database instance. Because the database is treated by the abstract API of Tokyo Cabinet, you can choose the scheme on start-up of the server. Supported schema are on-memory hash database, on-memory tree database, hash database, and B+ tree database. This command is used in the following format. `dbname' specifies the database name. If it is omitted, on-memory hash database is specified" [@www-tyrant-fal-labs-specs].

A new, more robust version of Tokyo Cabinet entitled Kyoto Cabinet has been released and has taken the place of the original Tokyo Cabinet platform.
